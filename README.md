# PWA-TextEditor

I have developed a web-based text editor that operates seamlessly within web browsers. This text editor functions as a single-page application and adheres to Progressive Web App (PWA) standards. It has been designed with multiple data persistence techniques to ensure data redundancy in the event that a specific method is unsupported by the user's browser. Notably, this text editor can also be used offline.

To create this text editor, I began with an existing application and implemented methods for data retrieval and storage in an IndexedDB database. For this purpose, I utilized the "idb" package, which serves as a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. This package offers a range of valuable methods for data management and is trusted by notable companies like Google and Mozilla.
